# PyBEAR
**Note: We have officially stopped supporting Python2. While it is still possible to use PyBEAR with Python 2, please be aware that certain functions may no longer be functional.**

This is the Python SDK for the Westwood Robotics actuator module BEAR (Back-drivable Electromechanical Actuator for Robotics).

Current version: 0.1.3

In this version, the return format is always [([data1, data2, ...], error), ([data1, data2, ...], error), ...] no matter if returning only one register or more per BEAR. 

### New function: set_posi()
A new function set_posi() is added to clear absolute position error on BEAR, e.g., set_posi((id, position, tolerance)).

### Notes
It is advised to use the Boosted USB2BEAR/USB2RoMeLa device for maximum speed.

### Disclaimer
Use at own risk when using other generic RS485 dangles.

## Serial Port Setup
On Linux, you can use udev rules to create a stable `/dev/...` symlink for the adapter.
On Windows, the adapter shows up as a `COM` port and you should pass that port name directly, for example `COM7`.

The SDK itself works cross-platform through `pyserial`; the main thing to change is the port you pass into `Manager.BEAR(...)`.


## Installation Procedure
1. CD into PyBEAR/ directory and install the package with Python 3.

```bash
pip install .
```

2. Make sure pyserial, numpy, and termcolor are installed. Otherwise install the missing packages. You can check this by running: 

```bash
pip show pyserial numpy termcolor
```

3. Use the correct serial port for your OS when creating `Manager.BEAR(...)`.

4. Enjoy!

### New function in 0.1.3: set_posi()
A new function set_posi() is added to clear absolute position error on BEAR, e.g., set_posi((id, position, tolerance)). If tolerance is non-zero, BEAR tries to find the multi-turn value to match the expected position within the tolerance. If tolerance is zero, BEAR modifies the homing offset to match the expected position. A save_config() action will be performed automatically once set_posi() is successfully excuted. 

**Note: set_posi() only works with BEARs with battery-backed encoders: Panda, Kodiak and Mountain.**

When BEAR is free from Absolute Position error, Hardware Fault or Initialization error, set_posi() can be used to find homing offset autonomously. For example:
```bash
# Find and set homing offset for BEAR with ID 1 so that the present position is 2.0
id = 1
position = 2.0
tolerance = 0.0
bear.set_posi((id, position, tolerance))
```
If BEAR is in Absolute Position error, set_posi() can be used to clear it. 
**Note: set to non-zero tolerance when using set_posi() to clear Absolute Position error, then disable to clear the error.**
For example:
```bash
# Clear Absolute Position error on BEAR with ID 5 and find offset to make present position 0.0
id = 5
position = 0.0
tolerance = 0.2
bear.set_posi((id, position, tolerance))
bear.set_torque_enable((id,0))
```
